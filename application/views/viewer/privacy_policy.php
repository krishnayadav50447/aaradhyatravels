                        <p>First things first – your privacy is important to us. That might be the kind of thing all these notices say, but we mean it. You place your trust in us by using Aaradhayatravels.com services and we value that trust. That means we’re committed to protecting and safeguarding any personal data you give us. We act in our customers’ best interest and we are transparent about the processing of your personal data.</p>
                        
                        <p>This document describes how we use and process your personal data, provided in a readable and transparent manner. It also tells you what rights you can exercise in relation to your personal data (such as the right to object) and how you can contact us.</p>
                        <p>In fact, this single Privacy Statement applies to any kind of customer information we collect through our platform (such as when you contact our customer service team by email).</p>
                        <p>If you are one of our business partners, make sure to also check out our <a href="https://admin.booking.com/hotel/hoteladmin/privacy.html?lang=en-gb&utm_source=phc&utm_medium=privacy_and_cookie_link&utm_campaign=partner_network_footer">Privacy Statement for Business Partners</a> to understand how personal data is further processed as part of the business relationship.</p>

                        <p>We can’t help you book your car rental without information, so when you use our services there are certain things we ask for. This is typically routine information – your name, email address, and your payment information. We might also ask for your home address, billing address, phone number, date and place of birth, passport and driving licence information, government issued identification (where required by law) and the names of any additional drivers.</p>
                        
                        <p>In addition to this, we also collect information from the computer, phone, tablet or other device you use to access our services. This includes the IP address, the browser you’re using and your language settings. There are also situations in which we receive information about you from others or when we automatically collect other information.</p>
                        <p>This is the general overview but if you’d like to know more about the information we collect, we go into more detail below.</p>
                        <p>If you need to get in touch with our customer service team, or reach out to us in a different way (such as social media) we’ll collect information from you there, too. This applies whether you are contacting us with feedback or asking for help using our services.</p>
                        <p>You might also be invited to write reviews to help inform others about your car rental experience. When you write a review on the Aaradhayatravels.com platform, we’ll collect any information you’ve included, along with your display name.</p>
                        <p>If you create a user account, we’ll also store your personal settings and reviews of previous bookings. This saved data can be used to help you plan and manage future bookings or benefit from other features only available to account holders (such as incentives or other benefits).</p>
                        <p>We may offer you referral programs or sweepstakes, and participating in these will mean providing us with relevant personal data.</p>

                        <p>Of course, you might not simply be making a booking for yourself. You might be booking a car rental with an additional driver or making a booking on someone else’s behalf. In both those scenarios, you will provide their details as part of the booking.</p>
                        
                        <p>In some cases, you might use Aaradhayatravels.com to share information with others. This can take the form of participating in a referral programme, as described when you use the relevant feature.</p>
                        <p>At this point, we have to make it clear that it’s your responsibility to ensure that the person or people you have provided personal data about are aware that you’ve done so, and that they have understood and accepted how Aaradhayatravels.com uses their information (as described in this Privacy Statement).</p>

                        <p>Whether or not you end up making a booking, when you visit our websites, we automatically collect certain information. This includes your IP address, the date and time you accessed our services, and information about your computer’s hardware and software (such as the operating system, the internet browser used, software/application version data and your language settings). We also collect information about clicks and which pages have been shown to you.</p>

                    <div class="faq_answer">
                        <p>The main reason we ask you for personal details is to help you organise your online bookings and ensure you get the best service possible.</p>
                        
                        <p>We also use your personal data to contact you about the latest deals, special offers and other products or services we think you might be interested in. There are other uses, too. If you’d like to find out what they are, read on for a more detailed explanation.</p>
                        <p>We use the information collected about you for a variety of purposes. Your personal data may be used in the following ways:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Bookings: First and foremost, we use your personal data to make and administer your booking, and to forward the necessary details to the company that provides you car (or other product or service, such as insurance). This includes sending you communications in relation to your booking, such as confirmations, modifications, reminders and billing (including issuing invoices). In some cases this may also include processing your personal data to enable online check-in or processing personal data in relation to damage deposits.</li>
                            <li>Customer service: We provide customer service from our offices and we’re here to help 7 days a week. Customer service teams need your details so they can help you make a booking, for example, or to reply to any queries you may have before, during or after your booking.</li>
                            <li>Account facilities: To make things easier, you can create a user account on our platforms. This involves giving us your personal data, and it lets you do a number of useful things. We use the information you give us to administer this account, allowing you to do a number of useful things. You can manage your bookings or other purchases, take advantage of special offers, and manage your personal settings and preferences. It also makes it easier to make future bookings. Managing personal settings gives you the ability to easily see car rentals you’ve searched for and check information you’ve provided.</li>
                            <li>Marketing activities: We use your information for marketing activities. These activities include:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Using your contact information to send you regular news about our special offers, discounts and updates, including details of our travel-related products and services (and/or those of our group companies or affiliate business partners). You can unsubscribe from email marketing communications quickly, easily and at any time – just click the “unsubscribe” link in any email.</li>
                                    <li>Based on your information, individualised offers might be shown to you on the Aaradhayatravels.com website and the content of the site displayed to you might be personalised. These could be offers that you can book directly on the Aaradhayatravels.com website, on co-branded sites, or other third-party offers or products we think you might find interesting.</li>
                                    <li>Contacting you by phone, email or SMS with information about insurance products that you didn’t include in your booking.</li>
                                    <li>Inviting you to participate in promotional activities (such as sweepstakes, referral programmes or competitions). When you participate in other promotional activities (such as sweepstakes, referral programmes or competitions), only the relevant information will be used to administer these promotions.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Communicating with you: There might be other times when we get in touch, including by email, by post, by phone or by texting you. Which method we choose depends on the contact information you’ve previously shared. We process the communications you send to us. There could be a number of reasons for this, including:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Responding to and handling any requests you have made.</li>
                                    <li>If you have started but not finished a booking online, we might contact you to invite you to continue with your booking. We believe that this additional service benefits you as it allows you to pick up the process where you left off without having to search for a car rental or fill in your booking details again.</li>
                                    <li>When you use our services, we might send you a questionnaire or invite you to provide a review about your experience with Aaradhayatravels.com or the car rental company.</li>
                                    <li>Sending you other material related to your bookings, such as how to contact Aaradhayatravels.com if you need assistance at the pick-up desk, and information that we feel might be useful to you in planning or getting the best out of your car rental. We might also send you material related to upcoming bookings or a summary of previous bookings you made through Aaradhayatravels.com.</li>
                                    <li>Even if you don’t have an upcoming booking, we may still need to send you other administrative messages, which could include security alerts.</li>
                                    <li>Sending you a summary of your previous bookings.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>Market research: We sometimes invite our customers to take part in market research. Please see the information that accompanies this kind of invitation to understand what personal data will be collected and how that data is used.</li>
                            <li>Improving our services: We also use personal data for analytical purposes and product improvement. This is part of our commitment to making our services better and enhancing the user experience. In this case, we use data for testing and troubleshooting purposes, as well as to generate statistics about our business. The main goal here is to get insights into how our services perform, how they are used, and ultimately to optimise and customise our website and apps, making them easier and more meaningful to use. As much as possible, we strive to use de-identified data for this analytical work.</li>
                            <li>. Customer reviews: During and after your booking, we might invite you to submit a review. This invite asks for information about the car rental company and your experience. You can choose to display a screen name next to your review, instead of your real name. By completing a review, you’re agreeing that it can be displayed (as described in detail in our <a href="<?php echo base_url('terms-condition');?>">Terms and Conditions</a> on, for example, our platforms, on our mobile apps, on our social media accounts and social media apps, or other channels owned, hosted, used or controlled by Aaradhayatravels.com. This is to inform other customers about the quality of the car rental company you used and any other experiences you choose to share.</li>
                            <li>Call monitoring: During calls with our customer service team, live listening might be carried out or calls might be recorded for quality control and training purposes. This includes the usage of the recordings for the handling of complaints, legal claims and for fraud detection. Not all calls are recorded and recordings are kept for a limited amount of time before being automatically deleted unless Aaradhayatravels.com has determined before then that the recorded calls need to be retained for fraud investigation or legal purposes (as further described below).</li>
                            <li>Promotion of a safe and trustworthy service: To create a trustworthy environment for you, any additional drivers, Aaradhayatravels.com’s business partners and car rental companies, we continuously analyse and use certain personal data to detect and prevent fraud and other illegal or unwanted activities. Similarly, we use personal data for risk assessment and security purposes, including when you report a safety concern, or for the authentication of users and bookings. When we do this we may have to stop or put certain bookings on hold until we’ve finished our assessment.</li>
                            <li>Legal purposes: Finally, in certain cases, we may need to use your information to handle and resolve legal claims and disputes, for regulatory investigations and compliance, to enforce our Terms and Conditions or to comply with lawful requests from law enforcement and other public authorities.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Providing your personal data to Aaradhayatravels.com is voluntary. However, we may only be able to provide you with certain services if we can collect some personal data. For instance, we can’t process your booking if we don’t collect your name, email address and payment details.</p>
                        <p>If we use automation to process personal data which produces legal effects or significantly affects you, we will always implement the measures required to safeguard your rights and freedoms. This includes the right to obtain human intervention.</p>
